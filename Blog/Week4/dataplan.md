# Week 4 Part 1: Data Plan Update
<b>Google Trends data</b>: https://trends.google.com/

This website contains all the search trends on Google based on states/cities. We can enter selected TikTok recipes and download the CSV data by state. Then, we need to generate latitude and longitude so we can map the data. We can use circle markers and use the size to represent popularity. 

<b>Weather data</b>

1. Weather API: https://openweathermap.org/history

    This contains the hourly historical weather data for any location via API. We will have to figure out if this is usable after learning how to incorporate API into our websites. Also, the website says that the availability of data depends on the type of your subscription, so it may not be free.

2. NOAA Climate data: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search

    This website allows us to search for weather data of specific locations and we can choose which variables to include. For example, average precipitation, snowfall, and temperature of a month. However, the website does not allow us to download a large amount of data at once, we may want to consider shortening our time period to only the last quarter of 2021.

    The data will be downloaded as a CSV file. There may be a need to generate latitude and longitude. We can map data into different layers with different sets of icons. The popup contains different information about the states. If possible, we can also present our data as a heat map.

<b>Demographic Data (US Census)</b>: https://www.census.gov/

The data will be downloaded as a CSV file. We can download the census data by state, so to examine the demographics of different states and see if there are any interesting correlations with the trends. We can also map it as a layer, with bubbles indicating population size/ other indicators.
