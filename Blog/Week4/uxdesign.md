| This mind map contains the homepage of our website. It includes the different tabs we want and it is more engaging by embedding TikTok videos in a slideshow. | This mind map contains a header with the group name and the title of project with an image background in the banner. The tabs are pages for the user to navigate the website. A map with markers is immediately visible with a description of our project right next to it. The clickable modules on the bottom show the different regions with more specific details and highlights.
