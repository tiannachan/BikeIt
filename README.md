# DH151-SocialMedia - Project Proposal

## Introduction
Our Team name is Bluebirds.
 
Our goal is to research trending Google Search hashtags on popular TikTok recipes in 12 selected states all over the United States. By comparing the weather, demographics, and related information of each state, we will identify correlations, trends, and discuss why certain recipes are so successful in some states but not in the other.

## Overview
The research inquiry focuses on the usage of Google search and its trends of TikTok recipes in 12 different states, chosen by their population and uniqueness. This is a matter of importance in comparing and analyzing the trends across the United States to understand social behavior and popular culture in the United States. 
 
<i> Potential Research Questions: </i> 
1. How does weather correlate with certain recipes?  <br>
2. How do demographics, such as population differences, age group, social political aspects, or health trends in specific states affect the popularity of certain recipes? <br>
3. How does the origin of the trend affect the spread of popularity?
 
## Methodology
We decided to choose web mapping as a methodology of inquiry because of the various regions around the world having multiple social media platforms that shape each country and their society. Furthermore, since we are trying to illustrate the data in terms of different regions, it is useful to visualize a map that better tells the story than purely text or simple charts.
 
## Workflow
Structure: We will have weekly zoom meetings to collaborate and brainstorm ideas for the project. Having constant communication via Slack and keeping each other accountable for the work to be done. <br>

## Technical Scope
We would like to design our web pages using css and writing them in HTML, which we can share and edit the codes using Google Docs. We are also collaborating on Github, so we can push, pull, and sync our collaborative work via Visual Studio Code. Moreover, we will include Javascript for interactive elements such as an interactive web through Leaflet. We will also use relevant data cleaning tools such as Tableau to organize our sources and create necessary visualizations. 
 
## Geographic Scope
We would like to look at the United States and compare/contrast states. We have chosen 12 states, 3 from each US region, including the Northeast, Midwest, South, and the West.<br>
For the Northeast, we have chosen…. Because..<br>
For the Midwest, we have chosen….Because..<br>
For the South, we have chosen….Because..<br>
For the West, we have chosen California, Washington, and Utah. The former two were chosen based on their population and their differences in weather, while the latter one was because of its unique history and culture. <br>
