 <h1>Introduction: Leaving Traffic Jams Behind - What is Metro Bike Share ? </h1>
    <p>Riding a bicycle is a fun, healthy, and inexpensive way to get to and around Los Angeles. In partnership with Los Angeles County, Metro (one of the largest transportation services in the country) offers a unique biking program for efficient affordable biking trips across the city. On an average week day, Meto transports over 1.5 million passengers through accessible services such as biking, trains, and buses. The Metro Bike Share Program in particular, offers citizens access to a variety of bikes 24/7 on a daily basis. Popular locations include Downtown LA, Hollywood,and Santa Monica. The program allows riders to conveniently commute around the city at affordable prices. It is also one of Metro’s most environmentally friendly public transportation options for Angelenos and visitors to get around.  
</p>
    
       
 <h1>Why is the program important ? </h1>
    <p>Biking has become a popular commuting method in large metropolitan areas in the United States. Metro’s bike share program plays a critical role in metropolitan transportation. City officials and corporations are increasingly adopting By offering sustainable transportation, citizens are able to navigate around the city safely at affordable rates. On the state level, California has one of the bicycling rates and Los Angeles alone tops as one of the cities with the highest bicycle commuters. The bike share program is a reflection of the landscape transformation of public transportation and evolution of technology. Metro corporation has reshaped the urban planning infrastructure of Los Angeles and no doubt fostered a bike sharing culture.</p> 

    <p>Active transportation policies such as the Bike Share Program are becoming more popular as a way to improve physical activity and implement environmentally friendly transportation, but little is known about public views on the program. The first Bike Share program originated in Netherlands Europe in 1965, which ignited the bike share movement Bike Share systems are popular in Europe whereas in the United States, implementations of the service are low in numbers. However, the number of public bike sharing programs has significantly risen across the United States since their beginning in 2010. A survey on users and non users of the program revealed that low-income and minority communities faced major impediments to bike sharing. Evidently, the study revealed low income areas in Los Angeles had low usage rates as compared to white populations. Our research aims to inform and identify the best practices and operation tactics that LA Metro might use to build a bike share program that is equitable and convenient for users.The goal of our map room is to spread public awareness of the Metro Bike Share program, support bicycling infrastructure investments in Los Angeles County, and highlight user statistics of the program based on the bike trip data.</p> 
    
 <h1>How Does Metro Bike Share Work ? </h1>
    <p>The Bike Share Program  is a non motorized transportation service with a network of shared bicycles. Metro utilizes smart bike technology that allows users to start and return bikes at any Metro bike service station at any time. Bikes are available 24 hours a day for short and long distance trips. Users can access our interactive map to view station locations, bike availability, and vacancies for returns (also available on the Metro Bike website/app). The system also charges users by hour increments and by passholder type.</p>

    <p>There are over more than 50+ Metro Bike stations and hundreds of bikes available across Downtown, UCLA, Hollywood, Culver City etc. Station locations are based on transit hotspots, space availability, and sunniness due to stations being solar powered.</p>
    
    <p>To Use: Users must use the Metro Bike Share pass or purchase a single walk-up ride at the station kiosk for non-pass holders. If using a pass, riders simply need to scan their card to lock and unlock the bike at the station dock. If purchasing a walk-up ride, riders must use their credit card at the kiosk and answer security questions before usage.</p>

  <h1> Research Methods </h1>
    <p>For our analysis, we used Metro Bike share trip data of Los Angeles that is available on the Metro official website. We aim to critically map bike sharing services to users real time and distinguish the program’s usage. We take into consideration the availability of bikes based on the area, trip duration, and demographics. In addition the Bike Share data helps critique the spatial and technological access of bikes across the city. </p>
    
    <p> Our data was organized and thoroughly cleaned through Breve, a data cleaning software. Since our data consists of numeric information, we wanted to construct a clean data set for the purpose of our visualizations. This process included editing missing numeric data and outliers. With a clean data set, each bike trip is organized by real-time locations, bike routes, and durations.</p> 

    <p> Through the humanistic perspective, we aim to identify and critique the program’s performance. Our map room highlights relevant bike trip data and transit services enables users to understand the city's transportation infrastructure. No doubt, the usage and popularity of bike sharing has drastically shifted over time due to technology and improved urban planning by LA County officials. Over time, we have witnessed the emergence of safe bike lanes around the city, especially in downtown Los Angeles. Our work pinpoints the expansion of safe commuting options based on the network of bike sharing services and how biking is not only just a form of transportation, it  is a step forward toward sustainable options. As a society, it is important to recognize the power of biking in terms of our health and the environment. Major transit corporations such as Metro have  the power to enhance our commuting experiences and educate us on cycling safety. Our unique analysis of bike trip data captivates the shifting development of public mobility. </p>
