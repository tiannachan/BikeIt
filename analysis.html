    <p>Riding a bicycle is a fun, healthy, and inexpensive way to get to and around Los Angeles. In partnership with Los Angeles County, Metro (one of the largest transportation services in the country) offers a unique biking program for efficient affordable biking trips across the city. On an average week day, Meto transports over 1.5 million passengers through accessible services such as biking, trains, and buses. The Metro Bike Share Program in particular, offers citizens access to a variety of bikes 24/7 on a daily basis. Popular locations include Downtown LA, Hollywood,and Santa Monica. The program allows riders to conveniently commute around the city at affordable prices. It is also one of Metro’s most environmentally friendly public transportation options for Angelenos and visitors to get around.

 <h1>Why is the program important ? </h1>
    <p>Biking has become a popular commuting method in large metropolitan areas in the United States. Metro’s bike share program plays a critical role in metropolitan transportation. City officials and corporations are increasingly adopting By offering sustainable transportation, citizens are able to navigate around the city safely at affordable rates. On the state level, California has one of the bicycling rates and Los Angeles alone tops as one of the cities with the highest bicycle commuters. The bike share program is a reflection of the landscape transformation of public transportation and evolution of technology. Metro corporation has reshaped the urban planning infrastructure of Los Angeles and no doubt fostered a bike sharing culture.</p> 

    <p>Active transportation policies such as the Bike Share Program are becoming more popular as a way to improve physical activity and implement environmentally friendly transportation, but little is known about public views on the program. The first Bike Share program originated in Netherlands Europe in 1965, which ignited the bike share movement Bike Share systems are popular in Europe whereas in the United States, implementations of the service are low in numbers. However, the number of public bike sharing programs has significantly risen across the United States since their beginning in 2010. A survey on users and non users of the program revealed that low-income and minority communities faced major impediments to bike sharing. Evidently, the study revealed low income areas in Los Angeles had low usage rates as compared to white populations. Our research aims to inform and identify the best practices and operation tactics that LA Metro might use to build a bike share program that is equitable and convenient for users.The goal of our map room is to spread public awareness of the Metro Bike Share program, support bicycling infrastructure investments in Los Angeles County, and highlight user statistics of the program based on the bike trip data.</p>
